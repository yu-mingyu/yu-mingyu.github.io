I am a second-year PhD student in the [Department of Mathematics](https://math.nd.edu/) at the University of Notre Dame. My main research interest is in nonlinear PDEs, particularly mathematical fluid dynamics, stochastic differential equations, and numerical analysis. My advisor is [Prof. Jiahong Wu](https://sites.nd.edu/jiahong-wu/). I did my undergrad in applied mathematics at UC Berkeley.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
