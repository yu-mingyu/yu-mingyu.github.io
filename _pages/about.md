I am a fourth-year applied math student at [UC Berkeley](https://math.berkeley.edu/). I am working with [Federico Pasqualotto](https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/fpasqual/home) on the self-similar solution to the slender-jet model emerging in fluid dynamics.  

Before transferring to UC Berkeley, I was at [UC San Diego](https://math.ucsd.edu/), where I worked with [Reuven Hodges](https://rhodges-math.github.io/) on a combinatorial pattern-avoidance conjecture of the Schubert varieties indexed by the elements of tybe $$B_n$$ Coxeter groups.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
