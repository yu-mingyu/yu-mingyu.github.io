## A numerical self-similar study on singularity formation of the slender-jet model

<!-- In this research, we consider 

$$
\begin{aligned}
    &\partial_t \rho + \partial_x( u \rho) = 0,\\
    &\partial_t (\rho u) + \partial_x(\rho u^2) - \partial_x( \rho^{\frac 12}) = \partial_x (\rho \partial_x u).
\end{aligned}
$$ -->
